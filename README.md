# MorkazSk
Addon to Skript with nice extra missing and upgraded features!

## Getting started
This skript addon, at the begining, has been created only for GC2.PL. There were various things added that were not existing in Skript at that moment. On spigot site there was published version that had tiny part of features of main version of MorkazSk. At begining of 2019 it has been recoded to create it much better for newest minecraft versions up from 1.13! Also, published version will now contain all features, not only part of them. It will be also updated recently because our big network will also use this addon :)!
